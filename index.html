    <!-- Chosen Palette: Electric Blue Dark -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application structure remains a single-page collapsible accordion for its proven usability. However, the user experience is enhanced with gamification and rich visual feedback. Key interactions are now more rewarding: 1) Accordion toggles have smoother animations. 2) Checkable problem lists now trigger a confetti burst, providing positive reinforcement. 3) The progress bar is gamified with a moving rocket icon. 4) A dynamic motivational quote section adds a human touch. 5) A persistent countdown timer maintains urgency. This structure retains the organizational benefits while making the learning process more engaging and less monotonous. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Overall Progress -> Goal: Motivate/Inform -> Viz/Presentation: Gamified Progress Bar with Rocket Icon (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Updates on checkbox click, icon moves along the track -> Justification: Transforms a static metric into a dynamic and visually rewarding journey. | Report Info: Problem Completion -> Goal: Reward/Reinforce -> Viz/Presentation: Confetti Animation (Canvas-Confetti JS) -> Interaction: Triggers on checkbox click -> Justification: Provides immediate, joyful feedback, making the act of completing a task more satisfying and memorable. | Report Info: User Motivation -> Goal: Inspire -> Viz/Presentation: Dynamic Quote Display (JS Array) -> Interaction: Shows a new quote on each page load -> Justification: Adds a small element of surprise and encouragement to the user's daily routine. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
